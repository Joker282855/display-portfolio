            <h2>Project 1</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Problem Addressed: There are times where people can not remeber the artists of a particular song they are trying to remember. Our applications allows users to search
                        for a songs made by any artists which helps them remeber songs they can't remeber. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Concepts/Technologies Used: The initial concept was to give allow our user to find songs that fit his or hers mood. We were on our way to accomplishing this goal with our
                        application before complications made us change course. The complications that arose were having two group members not being able to push commits to our github 
                        repostiory and one group member not having time to work on the website. We decided to have our website be a music finder and random music story generator due to
                        these complications. The design concept we used was user responsive design. 
                        Technologies Used: Visual Studio Code, Github, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Media Queries, and Fetch Requests. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Project 2</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Problem Addressed: Teachers have the responsibility of teaching multiple groups of kids each day. Posting homework or materials for every single period he or she
                        teaches can be time consuming. Our application makes it possible for teachers to post homework or materials for all of the periods they teach in a single place. 
                        This cuts down on the time a teachers spends posting materials online and gives them more time to help students that are struggling in class. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Concepts Used: The concept for the project was to have an application where teachers can post materials their students can use for assignments and interact with
                        thier students through the use of comments. We were able to give our application the ability to have articles posted to it but, the comment section still has some
                        errors that need to be worked out. The coding concepts we used in our design of the application were Restful Api, MVC Framework, CRUD operations, and User 
                        Responsive design. 
                        Technologies Used: Visual Studio Code, Insomnia, Handlebars Javascript, CSS Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Seuelize.
