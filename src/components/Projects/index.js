                        Problem Addressed: There are times where people can not remeber the artists of a particular song they are trying to remember. Our applications allows users to search
                        for a songs made by any artists which helps them remeber songs they can't remeber. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Concepts/Technologies Used: The initial concept was to give allow our user to find songs that fit their mood. We were on our way to accomplishing this goal with our
                        application before complications made us change course. The complications that arose were having two group members not being able to push commits to our github 
                        repostiory and one group member not having time to work on the website. We decided to have our website be a music finder and random music story generator due to
                        these complications. The design concept we used was user responsive design. 
                        Technologies Used: Visual Studio Code, Github, HTML, CSS, and Fetch Requests
